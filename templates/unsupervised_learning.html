<h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p>Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on a dataset of unlabeled data.</p>
<p>The unlabeled data consists of input data without any corresponding output.</p>
<p>The goal of unsupervised learning is to learn patterns and structures in the data.</p>
<p>Some of the most common unsupervised learning algorithms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clustering</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction</li>
<li>Association rule mining</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsupervised learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to note that unsupervised learning models can only learn from the data that they are trained on.</p>
<p>If the training data is not representative of the real world, then the model will not be able to learn useful patterns.</p>
