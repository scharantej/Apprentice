<h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the model is trained on a dataset of labeled data.</p>
<p>The labeled data consists of input-output pairs, where the input is the feature vector and the output is the target variable.</p>
<p>The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function from the input to the output.</p>
<p>Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the output for new input data.</p>
<p>Some of the most common supervised learning algorithms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear regression</li>
<li>Logistic regression</li>
<li>Decision trees</li>
<li>Random forests</li>
<li>Support vector machines</li>
</ul>
<p>Supervised learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. However, it is important to note that supervised learning models can only learn from the data that they are trained on.</p>
<p>If the training data is not representative of the real world, then the model will not be able to make accurate predictions.</p>
