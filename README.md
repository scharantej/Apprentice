 ## Flask Application Design for Machine Learning Beginner's Learning Path

### HTML Files

**1. index.html**
- This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- It should contain a basic layout with a header, navigation bar, and a main content area.
- The navigation bar should include links to different sections of the learning path, such as "Introduction to Machine Learning," "Supervised Learning," "Unsupervised Learning," and "Projects."

**2. introduction.html**
- This HTML file provides an introduction to machine learning, explaining its basic concepts and applications.
- It should include text, images, and possibly a video to engage the learner.

**3. supervised_learning.html**
- This HTML file covers supervised learning, explaining its algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) and how they work.
- It should include interactive examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts.

**4. unsupervised_learning.html**
- This HTML file covers unsupervised learning, explaining its algorithms (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction) and how they work.
- It should include interactive examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts.

**5. projects.html**
- This HTML file lists various machine learning projects that the learner can undertake to apply their knowledge.
- Each project should include a brief description, the required skills, and links to resources for further learning.

### Routes

**1. @app.route('/')**
- This route handles the root URL ("/") and displays the content of index.html.

**2. @app.route('/introduction')**
- This route handles the "/introduction" URL and displays the content of introduction.html.

**3. @app.route('/supervised_learning')**
- This route handles the "/supervised_learning" URL and displays the content of supervised_learning.html.

**4. @app.route('/unsupervised_learning')**
- This route handles the "/unsupervised_learning" URL and displays the content of unsupervised_learning.html.

**5. @app.route('/projects')**
- This route handles the "/projects" URL and displays the content of projects.html.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should have a consistent design and user interface across all HTML files.
- The application should be responsive, meaning it should adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
- The application should include a way for users to track their progress and achievements as they complete different sections of the learning path.
